"I’m currently studying Applied Physics at RPI. I’m actually finishing up my second-to-last semester here. It's been a little rough, but next semester looks like it’s going to be a lot more fun than difficult, so I’m looking forward to that, at least. My plan right now is to go to grad school for material science. If I learn a little more coding, I can do some neat stuff with supercomputers and the modeling of systems. But I'm not sure if I'll be able to make that happen. At the moment, I’m looking more at going into research—material physics, stuff like that.

To be perfectly honest, though, I’m in the process of—pardon my language—getting my shit together for once. I’m dealing with a recent breakup, and while we’re both handling it very amicably and we’re still friends, I’m getting into the process of fixing all the things I realized were making me not the person I wanted to be. So I wake up in the morning and think, 'Today’s a chance to make myself better.'"
