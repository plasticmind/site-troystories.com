There are days when Troy puts on big events like this Victorian Stroll, and it really makes it worth living here. I don’t know… it might sound corny, but I really like living here. It’s a good day... especially when you've got friends who have a good sense of humor. Then no matter what the situation is, they’re always good for a laugh. This from a guy in a stovepipe hat! \*laughs\*
