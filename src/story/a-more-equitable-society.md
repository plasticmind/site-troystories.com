Right now—and I think a lot of people probably feel the same way coming off this election—it’s a bit of a struggle to see what direction this country is going and where am I going to go along with it and what decisions do I have to make? We’re all facing those questions. I hope we move toward a more equitable society where everyone’s voice is truly heard and represented. Unfortunately, I don’t think that’s the case, and I don’t think it’s what we saw during the election.

Now is the time we need to find those voices. We don’t have an election coming up again any time soon. We have to find those voices, listen and talk and engage more often in conversations. And hopefully through a groundswell we’ll see more significant change and something that represents the society that we want.
