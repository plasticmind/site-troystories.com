I was a drinker, and I’m fighting that every day. Alcoholism... that’s a pretty big struggle. I’d get a few too many, and I’d be a very different person. But I did one treatment of acupuncture, and it worked. I was also a two-pack-a-day smoker. I did laser acupuncture—one treatment, twenty minutes—and I haven’t smoked since. That was 8 years ago. I’m also a clearer thinker now. I can hop in the car and drive to the store without worrying about breaking the law.

That's my struggle, but I guess everybody's got something they struggle with. We’re really all the same, in a roundabout way.
