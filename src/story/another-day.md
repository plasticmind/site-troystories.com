"At some point in life, you realize you have another day. And if you have another day, then you have choices and options. I think the fact that I’m still working, and I’m 75 years old… that’s a passion, in a way. I used to teach, but now I’m in the student services business. I will probably be doing what I’m doing now until I’m disabled or dead. That, more than anything, is important to me... but it’s not just that one thing. The longer you live, you develop more passions, more connections to the world."
