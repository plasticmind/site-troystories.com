I’ve been a professional sculptor most of my life. I also write. Frankly, money is what motives me as an artist. Of course, there's more to it than that, but it's my job, y'know? A profession. It's nice if you're dealing with subject matter that appeals to you. And sometimes it's just the challenge that moves me forward, "Can I do this impossible thing?" I guess I find most of my joy in my own artwork, the challenges I absorb myself into.

In all honesty, though, I would almost never express it that way; joy is kind of a concept that's passed me by for a while, especially as I struggle to stay afloat financially. I've got a few large commissions I'm waiting to hear on that I think might come through, so I'm hoping things turn around soon.
