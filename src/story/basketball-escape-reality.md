It’s easy to get involved with drugs these days, especially where I live, but I try to stay focused on positive things.

Like, I stay focused on basketball. I’ve been playing since I was five. It’s an escape from reality for me, you know? When I'm playing basketball, I'm not worrying about anything else like getting shot, getting arrested, all that stuff. It's just... basketball.
