"Since I was young, all I’ve wanted is to be a good mother. That’s my life. I want more kids. I’d eventually like to have 10 kids. I grew up with 10 kids in our house. My mother raised her sister’s kids, her brother’s kids, and her own sisters. I watched her and thought, ‘I want to do that.’ I was so thankful for that experience. I loved my cousins living with us. I loved sharing a room, sharing beds. We had four girls in one room; it was amazing… for me, anyway. They might tell you something different. \*laughs\* But I loved being part of a big family. Being a mom and having a big family is what I've always wanted to do."
