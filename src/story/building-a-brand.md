My job is what brings me the greatest joy in my life right now. I work the dish room in the dining hall at RPI. It’s a great job. I’ve worked here 3 years. I’m learning a lot about food prep and cooking. I eventually want to start my own catering company and build from there. I’m using what I learn here to my own advantage, doing solo projects.

Yeah, it’s a hard job, but it really is worth it in the end because you get a lot of good information, especially if you don’t have any background in culinary arts. You can talk with someone older or someone with more experience and they’ll be like, “try this or try that.” You take that home and experiment, and you become good and people start to like your food... then, you can start a brand.

That’s what I’ve been doing, trying to build a brand for myself. I want it for myself so I can branch out. I’ve been trying, y’know?
