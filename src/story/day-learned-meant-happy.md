The day I learned what it meant to be happy was the day I walked into a diner in Washington, New Jersey—the day I found her. A friend of mine said to me, “You gotta go to this diner. It’s the greatest food in the world. Plus, there’s this girl there who is gorgeous.” Well, I walked in and said, “Wow, you’re right!” But he was like, "No, no, not her." He had actually been talking about a different girl! Didn't matter to me, though. I told him, "No, that's the girl." We lost touch after that for a while, but then one day, out of the blue, she called me up.

_I Googled him. He wore a work tag when he came into the diner, so I remembered his name from the tag, then Googled it later. I found him, then I called him._

And I ended up the luckiest guy in the world.
