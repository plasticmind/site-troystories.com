I didn’t stay in school. I wish I had. I’d be better off right now. I’d be on a better path. I’d definitely have my career up and going, but I made a lot of dumb mistakes in high school. If I could choose a different career, it would probably be with something with animals. I always wanted to study zoology and work in a wildlife sanctuary.
