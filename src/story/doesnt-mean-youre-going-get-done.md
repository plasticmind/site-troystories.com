“Friends of mine who were like family put me on the bus to Albany from New York City because they knew I was about to do something real wrong. Well, not wrong, really… it was because of something done to me. See, I’ve got this scar on the back of my head. Five or six guys jumped me. I never saw it coming, it just happened. I fell down on my face, that’s why my eye is scarred too. After the doctors went in and fixed it up, some guys I knew brought me two guns and told me, ‘handle your business.’ So I found the corner where they were all together in one spot — that’s the way I wanted it. I had the ammunition to do it, too. But my friend stopped me from doing it. He caught me, and the bullets went into the ground. Those other guys knew it though… they took off. I’m glad I didn’t do it, but it didn’t just feel like the right thing, it **was** the right thing. People do shit like that to you? It’s not right. I could’ve died, you know what I mean? But if I’d done it, I probably wouldn’t be sitting here, that’s for sure. You take five guys out, what do you think they’re going to do to you? You’re going to jail for life. That’s why my friends knew it was time for me to get out of there.

Purpose in life? Not really. There’s a lot of things you might want to do; doesn’t mean you’re going to get them done. I’m at an age now where that just ain’t gonna happen. I always wanted to be an entertainer. I like to sing, to dance. I’m a comedian if you could believe that… a dirty comedian, you know, not stuff I can really do in public. I can do some clean material, but when I get into it, I’m going in deep. That’s just the way I am. Sometimes, I even do it out here on the streets. If I’ve got people around me and I’m in a good mood, I’ll have everybody on the ground.”
