I’m finishing up with my Masters in Public Health. Now I need to get a “real” job.

I’m just not sure how things will change in the future. One of the neighboring laboratories just got funding for work they’re doing with the Zika virus because they’re frontrunners in that area; but I’m not sure about the future, especially all the unknowns around Obamacare. I’m sure there will be some budget cuts in that field, but… I do research. I work in a lab, so what I’m doing probably won’t be directly affected. Research will probably still get funding.

I definitely enjoy research, but I don’t know if it’s my primary passion in life. I’m kind of using it as a stepping stone. Ultimately, I want to go on to equine medicine… I guess I just like animals a lot more.
