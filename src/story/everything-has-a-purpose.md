Joy, for me, is about having a close relationship with God. Being able to know that whatever happens during my day, I have something I can hold on to. Everything has a purpose, so I don’t really have to worry about bad things that might happen.

I was raised a pretty solid Christian, but since I’ve gone to college, I’ve started focusing on that relationship more. There's a group at RPI called CRU. It’s a Christian organization where a bunch of people get together, build each other up, read the Bible together, pray together. I love being a part of that.
