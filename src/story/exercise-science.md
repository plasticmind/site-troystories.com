"I grew up playing sports. My favorite was definitely basketball, but now I play college football. I saw so many injuries in sports, it made me look behind them and ask questions like what makes bones so weak and how can we help make them stronger. That’s why I decided to study Exercise Science at Hudson Valley. It's really all about personal training, physical therapy, injury management. When I’m done with school, I’d like to take what I’ve learned and start my own orthopedic medical practice."
