“I work at the library down in Albany. I’ve been there 15 years. I’m the maintenance man. I clean the floors, put the books away. My father owned a dairy farm up in Schaghticoke, and I used to have to milk cows for a living. All of the other kids eventually got married and moved away. I couldn’t run the farm by myself, because we were milking over 300 head a day. So I decided to sell it and move down here to Troy. I miss it a little, but it sure is a lot less work! I’m getting up there in age, so it’s nice that I don’t have to get up at 4 o’clock in the morning like I used to!”
