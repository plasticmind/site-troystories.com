We kind of met through a friend. RPI has a convention every year called Genericon, and this friend of mine recommended it, so I went.  During the convention, me and my friend were trying to ditch a dude who was harassing us, so we ducked into an elevator. It was a small elevator and we were two big guys, and this guy here was already on, and... I swear, it sank down. We were scared to death. We we're like, “We’re all gonna die together!”

After that, we went to The Rocky Horror Picture Show… I think that was the first time we just genuinely hung out together, and we just hit it off. Have you ever seen that show Supernatural? He was like my Dean from Supernatural, so I just started calling him Fat Dean.

Now we're awesome friends.
