"I've worked this food pantry off-and-on for seven years. I started out helping my brother, but took it over for him when he got too old. After his heart attack, he started getting sick all the time as his system got worse, so I stepped in. Somebody else does all the paperwork and stuff, but I decide what to order, what to load up for everybody. We do all Troy housing, which is 1400 apartments—not that everyone there comes here—but when they need it, once a month they can come down and get it. I enjoy doing it. I enjoy meeting different people and talking with them. The hardest part is keeping enough in there so everyone stays supplied. Sometimes when we’re low or out of food, it’s tough to tell a family that they’ll have to come back in a week when they’re telling me they ain’t got nothin. But at the end of the day, I like what I’m doing and I'll keep on doing it as long as I can."
