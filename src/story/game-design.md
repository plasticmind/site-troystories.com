"Every day I wake up, I’m very happy to study about and design games. My major is game design. Of course, I like very much to play games too. I don’t exactly have a favorite game, because I have to play them all! But I hope to create a sandbox game. There’s a lot of freedom in a game like that. It’s like a new world for players. I’m into the art: designing the worlds, the world backgrounds, the characters. I’m from China; but I'm studying abroad, and I’m very excited to be studying at this school. Our department directors always send us emails about game development in Troy. Because I’m just a freshman, I have not so much experience… so, I have to wait. But I think it’s all very exciting!"
