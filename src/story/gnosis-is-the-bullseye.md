"I was walking through Troy one day and someone was handing out fliers about gnosis. It’s a practice through prayer, meditation, and self-reflection of raising your consciousness and connecting with your inner light, your inner being. There were classes in Troy at the time, and I knew someone who was going to them, so I started going and just never stopped. The classes taught me how to meditate and how to look at my spirituality through many different avenues of energy and chakra. You get in touch with your higher self. You connect with your higher self. But it’s really about how to become aware of your life, who you are, what’s going on, where you want to be and accepting and dealing with life in general.

I’ve been on a spiritual path for 30 years… I looked at everything. All the other spiritual paths kind of touch gnosis peripherally, but it wasn’t until I found out about and began practicing gnosis that I realized that was the bullseye. Everything else was a part of it, but gnosis was at the center of it all."
