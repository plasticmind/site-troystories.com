"I just got over 3 or 4 weeks of pneumonia. I’m better now, but that was not an easy task… missing work and trying to take care of the kids. I’m by myself, mom \*and\* dad of 3. And the system doesn’t help you just for a few weeks. You have to be out for a while. I got really run down because they sold the house we lived in for 9 years, and we ended up moving the whole house ourselves. Me, my 16-year-old, my 15-year-old, my 8-year-old, and a friend with a pickup did it all. We just finished unpacking not too long ago. It was rough, but God willing, I’m still going! I got it done!"
