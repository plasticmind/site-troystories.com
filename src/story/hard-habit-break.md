I've learned not to care about money very much. I’ve put myself in situations where I didn’t have material means, and found myself feeling very free and happy and not very worried. I think that worrying about your material situation definitely creates unhappiness.

_If you could say something to someone struggling with money, what would you tell them?_

Give away everything you own. \*laughs\* I’m a hypocrite. I haven’t done that, but I do think that’s what would make me happy if I could bring myself to do it.

_What keeps you from doing that?_

Habit, I guess. I’m in the habit of owning things, and it’s a hard habit to break. Someday I’ll get over it.
