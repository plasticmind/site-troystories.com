I love being a mother… most of the time. I’ve got three kids, but before they wake up in the morning, it feels like they’re already fighting. They fight all day long. Then they’re bugging me in the shower. It can be tiring, but I do love it. I think the biggest struggle I face is mostly just financial—trying to provide not just for what my kids need, but also what they want.
