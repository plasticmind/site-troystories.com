"Don’t take anything for granted. You can lose it all in an instant. People you’ve loved. Friends you’ve known. When you get to a certain age, everybody’s gone, y’know? It all changes so quickly. It’s kind of like… Troy has changed, but I still see it as it was, as I saw it growing up. My brother met somebody when he just started Troy High, and he’s been with her his whole life. One girl. Him and her. That’s it. My wife just makes me the happiest guy in the world. I only wish I would have found that companionship years ago."
