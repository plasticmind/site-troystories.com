"I wanna be a rapper. I’m working on my old school free-styling. I’m gonna talk to some guys I know that have studios, but I’m trying to fill two notebooks first. I’m a writer, I guess. Sing. Guitar. Poetry. I’ll even write songs, but my focus is rap. I put my stuff up on Facebook and I usually get like 100 to 150 views each time. That’s not crazy bad. I’m hoping when I come out with an album, it’ll be good."
