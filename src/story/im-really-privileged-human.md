"As I reflect back on my youth, it’s interesting how profound an influence the way my parents lived influenced the way I live today. And it wasn’t that they sat me down on the couch and said you will do this and this and this. I saw what they were engaged in, what gave them joy, and that became what gives me joy. It is self-interest. I’m not an altruistic person. I’m not sure I believe in altruism.  I believe everybody is driven by things that give them what they value. What I value is a good feeling for being a part of the community, making a contribution to the community, trying to raise others as well.

I recognize the benefits that I’ve been given not by virtue of hard work, but by virtue of luck: to be born in this country, to be born in a middle class family, to have an intact family with two parents. We weren’t well-off financially, but we never were hungry. I was in a community where my neighbors were as concerned about my well-being as my family was. So I was given all of these things. And it’s not to say I didn’t work, but I was supported in my efforts. I was nurtured in my efforts. I’m a really privileged human being in the grand scheme of things. I recognize that, and something inside me tells me that doesn’t come without a cost. I feel a responsibility to help others realize their potential the way I’ve been allowed to realize mine.

I guess the greatest struggle in my life has to be trying to find the balance between this job and my family. I feel as though I’ve neglected my family and friends since I started the campaign. I feel horrible that I’ve not been more of a family member. It’s a huge sacrifice. I’m not sure how many people fully understand that.  That’s my challenge: finding that balance. The city needs me to do a whole bunch of things. But my family also needs me, and I need to make sure I nurture those relationships."
