"I believe in outreach, giving back to the community. I want to find a place down the road that lets me make a difference in the world using engineering. That’s what motivates me to go through this process of college. I’m part of an organization that helps teach kids in middle school and high school about engineering, about the different type of engineers. A lot of kids don’t understand engineering, so we try to help get them motivated and inspired to become an engineer. I love doing that kind of stuff."
