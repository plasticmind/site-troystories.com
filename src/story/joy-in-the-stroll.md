Sometimes it's hard to get into the holiday spirit because my wife is battling lymphoma, but I find joy in the hope that we'll beat this and I'll have her with me for many Christmases to come. She's been doing treatments for the last few months and it seems like they're working. It's already a hard time of year because I lost my sister to cancer 14 years ago at Christmas. But we really like the Troy Victorian Stroll.  We get to get dressed up in festive clothes and walk the streets. People come up and take our picture. We get to see everyone celebrating and mingling. It just really helps us get in the holiday spirit and find some joy in tough times.
