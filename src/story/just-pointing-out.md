"Ain’t nothing going on for me. I’m on disability. I’m on a fixed income. Can’t take vacations. I guess I keep going on for my wife. I’ve been married 18 years. I can’t handle her nagging, though. She’s always bitching me out for being wrong. My wife’s a bitch… and she knows it. I call her that all the time. She’s the queen of bitches."

_There’s got to be something good about her._

"Oh I didn’t say there’s nothing good about her. I was just pointing out that she \*is\* the queen of bitches."

_And what does she call you?_

"An asshole."
