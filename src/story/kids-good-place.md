"My greatest sense of joy in life right now comes from knowing that my kids are good, and healthy, and in a good place in their own lives. My wife and I did a good job of raising them and we look forward to watching them grow. One's a freshman in college, one is a 26 year-old living and working in New York City, the other is 24 and lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Theyâ€™re both employed and my daughter is going to school to be a teacher, so everybody is in a good place. That means the world to me."
