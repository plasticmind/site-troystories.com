I am from Burma, but I am in the country for a poetry competition. AÂ friend of mine lives in Troy, so I thought I might explore the city a bit.

I will recite to you a few lines from one of my poems:

_life short_ _suffering tall_ _plenty of water_ _no fish, no fish at all_

Happiness. Suffering. All of it is short-lived.
