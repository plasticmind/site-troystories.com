"Honestly, I just want a happy life with a happy wife. I just want to be rich. Being rich would solve my problems. They say mo’ money, mo’ problems, but I don’t agree. I’m flat broke right now, so I think more money would fix the problems I have. And you know what? Let me be that guinea pig. Yeah, go ahead and give me that money, and I'll show you it won’t bring me problems. I guarantee it would solve all my problems."
