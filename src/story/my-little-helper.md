"There’s not a lot that I’m driven by more so than my kids. I mean, I try to keep a healthy marriage. My husband and I have been married for 13 years. But I wake up every day for my kids. I guess y biggest struggle is that I never feel like there’s enough money. I want to make sure my kids have a house to live in. Make sure they’ve got food on the table. Make sure the lights stay on. Those are big priorities to me. My husband and I both work. We’ve got three different incomes, but it never seems like enough. I just want to make sure I keep my kids happy and bring them up as good people, smart, polite. I have a son who’s 12…”. ﻿ “He’s 11.” ﻿ “Oh right.” \*laughs\* "He’s 11. She’s my little…” ﻿ “Helper!”
