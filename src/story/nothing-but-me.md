"I just brought my mom and my little brother out from Iowa to support them. That’s why I’m working, to take care of them. I’ve got work here… really good work, too. Construction. I’ve always worked with my hands, but I haven’t always been handy. I used to wash dishes. Worked at a meat company. But I’d like to get into real estate. Flipping houses. I didn’t graduate high school, though; so that’s one step I’ve got to take to get me there, I think. Getting started is the hard part, though. But there’s nothing really that’s stopping me. Nothing but me, tell you the truth."
