"I honestly believe I don’t really want that much out of this life. My pleasures in life are really simple: the people in my life, being able to travel, being able to help my community. God blessed me with this million dollar brain. I have an amazing imagination, and I have so many great ideas. But the dreams aren’t cheap, and that’s where the money comes in. It’s the reality of things.

If you’ve got the money, you’ve got the voice. If you don’t, no one hears you. When I open the friggin’ business review and hear about some kid I’ve never heard of with a rich father who decided to develop an old warehouse. It’s like… poverty and wealth are bumping up against each other all of the time. Why is that? You can say, pull yourself up by the bootstrap or whatever, but, look… I’m keepin’ it 100. When I park my car out front of this building full of white people and there’s all these black people waiting for the bus out there who don’t know anything about what goes on inside. And the people on the inside don’t know anything about the people outside. How do you fix that?

You start by fixing it in yourself. You’re around people that think like you, and talk like you, and act like you… no one's thinking different, no one's challenging each other. When you start to realize that, you can start to change it. Start asking questions. But people don’t like to think differently. Look, I don’t care what you think, I just want you to think. I realized that even for myself… I was pigeonholing myself, feeling threatened by ideas that I’d never considered before. It’s hard work.

 I’m going through my own personal transformation—realizing what I want to change and what I need to do to get there. And, basically, it’s about doing the work. Do the work and you’ll reap the benefit. You’re either going to keep up or you’re just going to get left behind. And with everything changing so much—jobs and technology, you ain’t got no choice. You gotta do what you need to do."
