"I want to get my life together. I’m a diabetic. I want to start paying more attention to my health. I want to get my own house for my own family. Make my life better. Make my grandson happy. I want something better for him. I know what I need to do. I need to get back to school so I can learn to read and write. I want to be able to read street signs and learn the roads. I want to be able to read to my grandson. I wish I was just on a beach somewhere, like Hawaii or Florida, reading with my grandson. He’s my pride and joy. That's all I've got in life."
