My greatest struggle is definitely school.

I’m in night school right now. I can’t be in day school because I don’t have enough credits. I used to live in the city and didn’t do school at all.

But since my mom passed, school’s real important to me now. That’s why I came up here to Troy. Me and my brothers are trying to get an apartment together. We just gotta make it work.
