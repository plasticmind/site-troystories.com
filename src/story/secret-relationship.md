"I’ll never forget my first boyfriend. This was a long time ago… in my junior high school. He was a really cute boy, and I was extremely happy. I’m from China, and this kind of relationship was usually restricted at that age, so we had to keep it a secret. You know, pretend we weren’t boyfriend and girlfriend. I told my parents that we were just friends, but most of my classmates knew that we were dating. We're not dating anymore. It’s hard to say what happened to us, but I moved to another city for high school, and he stayed in my home town, so there was distance between us, which made it hard. But we are still friends. I’m not dating anybody now. This is my first year as a Ph.D student in Mathematics, so I really need to focus on my studies."
