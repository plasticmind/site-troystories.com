"I got a board 4 years ago, but I didn’t start taking it seriously until 2 years ago. Downtown has some great spots—under the bridge on Hoosick is good. But I usually just skate on the sidewalk out front of my house. I just got back into it because it’s been pretty cold this winter. Before winter, I would skate every day. It’s kind of hard because now I’ve got a job, but I still try to get out and skate as much as I can. I do it for fun. I’m not trying to make money on it or anything."
