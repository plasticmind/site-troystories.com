"He’s everything to me. I know I’m young, but I do like being a mom. It’s not bad once you get used to it. My family helped me a lot, which made it easier for me. After I had the baby, everything was different. It took me awhile to get used to getting up in the night and all that stuff, but it’s easier now that he’s bigger. I still can’t believe I had a kid."
