"As you get older, the prospect of death becomes more real, especially when you’re in your seventies. Your whole body changes. Your attitude changes. Sometimes, your attitude changes for the better. You become more mellow and you’re more appreciative of everything, especially the little things that at one time might not have mattered. And you certainly don’t get excited about things that go wrong anymore. Absolutely not. They don’t shake you quite as much.

I’m glad just to be alive. To be breathing. To know that I'm loved by my friends and my family. To be loved by God... I know he’s with me, seeing me every step of the way."
