"I worked 20 years on the garbage truck. Back in the day I used to work, no shirt, just shorts… in the winter time! But I’m out now. I keep myself occupied with walking. I take walks all over town and check on elderly people that I got to know when I worked on the garbage truck. I help them out. I check on their houses, keep an eye on them, clean them. I also wash a lot of windows. The Chinese place? I did those windows. The eyeglass place on 3rd Street? The dentist on 3rd Street? Did them all. All the old-timers in the police department know me. Just wait ’til the boys down there see this picture, they’ll love it. 'Oh boy, there’s our rookie!'"
