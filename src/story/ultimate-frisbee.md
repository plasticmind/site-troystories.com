"When the weather’s nice, I play ultimate frisbee. That’s the reason I do a lot of working out, trying to stay in shape, and all that jazz. It’s a big passion of mine, and it's a lot of fun. I picked it up at a summer camp when I was 12, but it’s one of those things that has always stuck with me and has become a pretty large part of my life. I’m a senior in mechanical engineering, so I’ll probably be going into industry. I’m actually looking into working at a company that helps make prosthetic limbs and organs. They’ve been playing with making heart valves from pig’s hearts because they’re very similar. I’m pretty passionate about sports therapy and physical therapy, probably because of ultimate frisbee. I always say ultimate frisbee players are just people who weren’t good enough to play regular sports. We’re all nerdy engineers."
