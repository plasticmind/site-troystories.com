"For over twenty years, I worked as a nutrition educator for one of Cornell University’s extension offices. I used to work in a number of different settings: with the elderly, in rehab centers, in children’s summer camps. It was all satisfying, but it was hard. It’s hard to change someone’s diet. It’s such a personal thing. So any little success was very gratifying. I especially liked introducing children to very healthy snacks. To put it in front of them, let them enjoy it, and have them know it was good for them… that was a high point for me.

As I move into old age, I find myself wanting to learn how to do watercolor painting. I find it very comforting. I took art lessons as a child, but I drifted away from it. I’d like to get back to it now and become somewhat proficient before I leave this world."
