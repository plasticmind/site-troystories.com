Couple of years ago I moved to Vegas for three weeks. But if you don’t have money, it’s worthless. If you’re not going out and gambling, there’s nothing to do. Nobody’s outside because it’s too hot. You never meet your neighbors. So I ended up coming back to Troy.

I don’t really do anything exciting. I’m either home, or I go to a bar and drink. I take life as it comes. I don’t struggle. I go with the flow. That’s my life philosophy. It works. Just doing what I know. This is what I do. Can’t say it always comes out right, but I do believe that it doesn’t matter what you accomplish in life. We all end up dead.

Queen's got a song—can’t think of the title right now—but there’s a line in there, “Rich or poor or famous, when we’re through it’s all the same.” That’s pretty much how I view life. I don’t take it seriously. I don’t worry about shit. What good is that? To me, worry is the biggest waste. What good are you going to do worrying about something? Like if you want money to pay your rent, unless you can do something about it, worrying doesn’t help you one bit.
