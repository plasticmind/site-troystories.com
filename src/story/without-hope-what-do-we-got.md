Be kind whenever possible… and it’s always possible. Engage with somebody because you don’t really know what their story is. It’s far easier to smile than to frown, and it pays off more at the end of the day. What’s the purpose of waking up every day with a bad attitude and being pissed at the world?

Maybe it’s not what you did at your desk all day that mattered. Maybe you were here for this one day, just to put a smile on one person’s face. Maybe your only job that day was to make that one person smile who didn’t have any reason to or any hope. After all, without hope… what do we got?
