When this project was active, I created a beautiful 18" x 24" poster made up entirely of portraits that appeared on Troy Stories. The poster was museum-quality print: 4-color staccato screening on 80# silk coated paper, printed by Snyder Printing on River Street in Troy. Proceeds from the sale of the poster went to help support Unity House.

[Unity House](https://www.unityhouseny.org/) is a human service agency based in Troy that helps meet the needs of people in our community who are hurting and struggling. They are still around and doing good work. Please consider supporting them.

The project is over, and the posters are not for sale. 

If you *are* interested in a poster and have donated to Unity House, please send an email to [jesse@plasticmind.com](mailto:jesse@plasticmind.com). I will see what I can do.

Thanks so much for supporting Unity House and their efforts to help underpriveleged people in Troy and beyond.
